Provides classes that enable reading SpreadsheetML.
<P>
The basic class for reading xml-spreadsheets of type spreadsheetML is
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReader}. 
It can deliver the contents of an xml-file or an 
xml-InputSource as a fully populated {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.Workbook}.
This package also offers an event-based model with the
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderListener ExcelReaderListener-interface} 
which can be fine-tuned with an {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderFilter} 
that acts as a wrapper for listeners.

Suppose you want to do something. Well rather, suppose you have an Excel-file
and you want to do something with it's contents and structure in Java. Here's
what you got to do:
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   Workbook xlWorkbook = reader.getWorkbook("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
Now what you have is a fully populated 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.XLWorkbook}, that is, the (almost) 
complete representation
of the Excel xml-file <code>myFile.xml</code> in Java class-instances. Now you can
inspect it's structure, process it's contents, alter it or send it to the president.
<P>
OOoops! You got an <code><font color="red">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
</font></code>, did ya? The thing is that the above code works fine as long as
your workbooks aren't too big. Every cell, row, worksheet and so on in the file
that you're reading is stuffed as an object into the one encompassing object
XLWorkbook. How much will go in there depends -among others- on your system
and VM-settings. So what if you want to read large files and huge input sources?

<H3 id="memory">Strategies for circumnavigating memory problems</H3>
There are several strategies to overcome the memory problems just mentioned:
<OL>
<LI>Cache memory-consuming XLElements in such a way that they can be found
easily and loaded back on to dynamic memory at the time we need them. 
The Row-element would be a likely candidate for caching.
<LI>Partial reading. Read only those parts of the workbook that we're interested in.
<LI>With an event-based interface we could process essential parts of the workbook
while reading. We would discard those parts as soon as we're finished processing
and not have the need to keep them in memory.
</OL>
The xelem.lex API realises strategies 2. and 3. What's more, the two strategies
can be mixed
and intermingled, procuring a flexible API that meets your every need.
<br>
[Mark that the event-based API will be faster. When for instance your object is 
to process rows from a workbook, with the event-based model
you only loop through all of the rows of
the workbook once. Building an XLWorkbook first and then iterate through all of it's rows
would take two loops.]

<a name="areas"><H3>Partial reading - setting the read area</H3></a>
When we know what part of the workbook we're interested in we can restrict reading
to that particular part. More precise, we can tell ExcelReader
which {@link nl.fountain.xelem.Area Area} of the worksheets to read.
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   <b>reader.setReadArea(new Area("E11:M16"));</b>
   Workbook xlWorkbook = reader.getWorkbook("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
The XLWorkbook that is returned will contain 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.SSWorksheet SSWorksheets} and
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.ss.SSTable SSTables} containing
only those cells, rows and columns that
were found in the specified area of the succesive worksheets. Apart from cells, rows,
columns, tables and worksheets, all other 
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.XLElement XLElements} will be present 
and fully populated. 
Mark that the above code will treat all the worksheets in the workbook in the
same way. If we want to set different read areas or clear the read area
for individual worksheets we need other code. We'll come to that. First let's
take a look at the event-based API. 

<H3 id="eventbasedmodel">The event-based model</H3>
We can register an {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderListener} on the
ExcelReader and recieve notification of parsing events and the construction
of {@link nl.fountain.xelem.excel.XLElement XLElements} while reading. Here's
a code-stub that enables us to process rows. We'll use an anonymous
implementation of the {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.DefaultExcelReaderListener}.
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   reader.addExcelReaderListener(new DefaultExcelReaderListener() {
       public void setRow(int sheetIndex, String sheetName, Row row) {
           <font color="green">// process row and/or it's cells
           // ...</font>
       }
   });
   reader.read("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
Of course we could do the same with a non-anonymous listener. And we could be
listening to events other then the setRow-event as well. 
<P>
When we're only interested
in particalur parts of the worksheets we might set the read area:
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   <b>reader.setReadArea(new Area("E11:M16"));</b>
   reader.addExcelReaderListener(new DefaultExcelReaderListener() {
       public void setRow(int sheetIndex, String sheetName, Row row) {
           <font color="green">// process row and/or it's cells
           // ...</font>
       }
   });
   reader.read("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
Now we will only be notified when the row is within the specified area and the
row only contains cells that were found within that area.

<H3 id="swapping">Swapping read areas</H3>
Up till this far we have used the setReadArea-method to set one area for
all the worksheets we were reading. Maybe we want to read different areas on
different worksheets. Using the event-model we can set different read areas
when different worksheets come along. (Or -for that matter- trigger what action
so ever on any event.) Here's a SwappingAreaListener:
<PRE>
class SwappingAreaListener extends DefaultExcelReaderListener {
    
   private ExcelReader reader;

   public SwappingAreaListener(ExcelReader reader) {
      this.reader = reader;
   }
   
   <font color="green">// override method in DefaultExcelReaderListener</font>
   public void startWorksheet(int sheetIndex, Worksheet sheet) {
      switch (sheetIndex) {
         case 1:
            reader.setReadArea(new Area("A1:C6"));
            break;
         case 2:
            reader.setReadArea(new Area("G11:G11"));
            break;
         default:
            reader.clearReadArea();
     }        
   }  
}
</PRE>
The SwappingAreaListener tells ExcelReader to only read particular areas on
sheets 1 and 2 and to read the rest of the sheets unrestricted. Mind that the
sheetIndex is 0-based. Here's how SwappingAreaListener might be fit in in
code that tells ExcelReader to get a workbook:
<PRE>
   ExcelReader reader = new ExcelReader();
   SwappingAreaListener sal = new SwappingAreaListener(reader);
   reader.addExcelReaderListener(sal);
   Workbook xlWorkbook = reader.getWorkbook("foo/bar/myFile.xml");
</PRE>
The returned XLWorkbook will have it's sheets populated according to the
restrictions imposed by SwappingAreaListener. Internally ExcelReader uses
a {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.WorkbookListener} to build the workbook and
events are being dispatched to both listeners. WorkbookListener uses these
events to build and populate the workbook, SwappingAreaListener at the same time
imposes restrictions. At the end of the read that is performed by the
getWorkbook-method ExcelReader removes the workbooklistener and then returns
the completed XLWorkbook. If you want to use the same ExcelReader to perform
more reads that must not be restricted, do not forget to remove 
the SwappingAreaListener.

<H3 id="filter">Using filters</H3>
An {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderFilter} is an
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.ExcelReaderListener} that can register other
listeners: it wraps other listeners. It's a sort of chain. The default
implementations of these interfaces
{@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.DefaultExcelReaderListener}
and {@link nl.fountain.xelem.lex.DefaultExcelReaderFilter} have contrary
behaviour. Events send to DefaultExcelReaderListener drop dead unless
it's subclass overrides the setXXX- or startXXX-method. Events
send to DefaultExcelReaderFilter are propagated unfiltered to the registered
listeners unless it's subclass overrides the method and takes appropriate action.
<P>
Filters and listeners can be configured in a variety of ways. For instance, we use an
EmptyRowFilter to count the number of empty rows on a worksheet and abandon
listening for further events on that sheet at a certain emptyRowCount. I'm sure
your imagination, inventiveness and creativity go beyond that.
